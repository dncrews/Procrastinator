* Change any GET submissions from forms to POST (e.g., when creating user account)
* Clean up routes, perhaps using Express (Sinatra-like routing)
* When hit /, check if authenticated. If not, go to login page; else, show home page
* Use templating, perhaps Underscore.js, to render dynamic page content (e.g., list of events)
