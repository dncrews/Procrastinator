Besides implementing the basic functionality, this is a wish list of development items:

[ ] Implement cron
    [ ] Check for event for all users, and send email or SMS on event
    [ ] Style past events so user knows they are passed

    |  new cronJob('* * * * * *', function(){
    |    console.log('You will see this message every second');
    |  }, null, true, "America/Los_Angeles");

[ ] Make database user & database name configurable. Right now, hardcoded in scripts/init.sql (with a slightly offensive password)

[ ] Error handling (e.g., if login fails; if database connection fails; I/O errors; etc.)

[ ] Deploy on Heroku (after fix potential security issues)

[ ] Password in `users` table currently stored in clear text; very least, use a very salty hash

[ ] Clean up basic server logic to be more idiomatically Express-like. See: http://expressjs.com/guide.html

[ ] Use less generic error pages for failed authentication

[ ] Pick a name ("Procrastinator"? "Procrastinate"? "Remind.Me"? ) and use consistently in site

[ ] Change table name `messages` to `events`


Feel good, these things are finished:

[x] Change any GET submissions from forms to POST (e.g., when creating user account)

[x] Clean up routes, perhaps using Express (Sinatra-like routing)

[x] When hit /, check if authenticated. If not, go to login page; else, show home page

[x] Use templating, perhaps Underscore.js, to render dynamic page content (e.g., list of events)
    (Nope, using Jade)

[x] Move all files to Jade, and use a single layout file to DRY
