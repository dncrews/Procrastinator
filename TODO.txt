Besides implementing the basic functionality, this is a wish list of development items:

[x] Change any GET submissions from forms to POST (e.g., when creating user account)

[x] Clean up routes, perhaps using Express (Sinatra-like routing)

[ ] When hit /, check if authenticated. If not, go to login page; else, show home page

[ ] Use templating, perhaps Underscore.js, to render dynamic page content (e.g., list of events)

[ ] Make database user & database name configurable. Right now, hardcoded in scripts/init.sql (with a slightly offensive password)

[ ] Error handling (e.g., if login fails; if database connection fails; I/O errors; etc.)

[ ] Let's deploy on Heroku (after fix potential security issues)

[ ] Password in `users` table currently stored in clear text; very least, use a very salty hash

[ ] Clean up basic server logic to be more idiomatically Express-like. See: http://expressjs.com/guide.html
